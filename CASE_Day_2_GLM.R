##Linear models are only appropriate when your outcome variable is continuous and unbounded

#If you want to model a categorical outcome, or a bounded outcome (like a proportion or percent),
#then you usually can't rely on regular linear modeling to do it
##CAVEAT: sometimes you can, if you're not running into the edges of your boundaries (e.g. 0 or 100)
